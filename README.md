## ‚ö° Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: (LTS version recommended) - Includes npm.
  - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) or **Yarn** (a fast, reliable, and secure alternative to npm).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohhaannn/portfolio.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```

3. **Install the project dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or, if you prefer Yarn:
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Project

To start the development server and view the application in your browser:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or, if you prefer Yarn:
yarn dev
```

This command will typically open the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:5173`. If that port is already in use, Vite will automatically select another available port. The development server features hot-reloading, so any changes you make to the code will instantly reflect in the browser.
